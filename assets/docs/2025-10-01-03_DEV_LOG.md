### 1. Why I Decided to Develop a Tool for Juxtaposing Two Languages?

It aims to improve the efficiency of my daily tasks on translation since I have been working on it for more than 7 years (as of this writing); a gut feeling tells me "Time to convert my efforts into something more specific — or more financially rewarding :）" since this *** work drained too much of my time and energy. So I need a program to make things easier and more comfortable (at least for my mental health).

### 2. Basic Functionality
Now then, there are plenty of rountine tasks as to how to standardise your translations and define the presence of a variety of phrases and expressions — an artistic equivalence to mathematics in STEM, I would say, why I've been asking for all of this?  Um, basically, it's part of my research and furthermore at its core & hub, however, which doesn't matter at all in this log — an odd fish in an odd barrel — Good. Allow me try to give an intro about fundamental functionality I need.

#### 2.1 Import
Due to time-cost considerations, two approaches are currently envisioned for the import function:
(a) inputting translated clauses one by one after daily translation work (the most common scenario), and

(b) bulk injection. The latter is still under consideration, with the idea being that entire passages (especially those translated in the past) could be injected into the database based on a standard sentence-ending delimiter such as a period.

#### 2.2 Search
This is the second-highest development priority after import. Search must include both source and target languages so that Chinese–English and English–Chinese comparisons can be carried out separately. Another key challenge under ongoing testing is how best to optimize the retrieved results.

Ideally, search results are expected to include the original source of the text, allow keyword-based text location, and record the injection time. If possible, a filter function is expected to be added later to retrieve text based on criteria such as day/month, combined with other filter conditions. Here's a sketch program built on streamlit:

#### 2.3 Basic Tree
This is a concept that can basically cover my daily workflow in translation.
```bash
translation-notes/
├─ DEV_LOG.md
├─ Home.py
├─ pages/
│   ├─ 1_Add_Entry.py
│   ├─ 2_Bulk_Import.py
│   └─ 3_Search_Export.py
```

### 3. Demonstration
The figure below shows what's happening using the `Go` tab. You can assume that I've added one entry already for test.

As you can see, also a convenient copy-paste button available there.

### 4. Future Plans
The immediate priority is to optimize the retrieved search results. Import has been progressing relatively smoothly so far, and the plan is to add time-based filtering functionality. Most importantly, I will need to inject a large volume of content in order to properly test the robustness and practicality of the software.
